# Lab 1: PostgreSQL and SK Agents

Large-Language Models (LLMs) enhance applications with semantic capabilities, such as natural language search. This lab will guide you to develop an agent-driven, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application to explore the U.S. Case Law dataset for factual information.

You will gain hands-on experience in building an agent-based app using Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Visual Studio Code, and the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework. This course will not only cover these technologies but also delve into AI and information retrieval techniques in practice, such as database vectors for (LLMs) and the DiskANN index for vector search. Additionally, you will learn how to integrate the GraphRAG pattern using Apache AGE for PostgreSQL, an extension that adds graph database functionality to PostgreSQL, leveraging the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework.

In Part 1, we will set up and populate the data in the database, as well as the Azure AI extension, and test the tools that we will use. Part 2 explores how to perform text searches using pattern matching, and demonstrates in practice how this can be significantly improved by relying on semantic vector search and vector indexes. In Part 3, we delve deeply into creating an agent that uses the GraphRAG pattern, a technique designed to improve the quality of results by extracting knowledge graph information from our data. Let's get started!

    3. This should return the folder location: `C:\Users\LabUser\Downloads\pg-sk-agents-lab`

		!IMAGE[psql-cmdline.jpg](instructions291546/psql-cmdline.jpg)

===

## Populate the Database with Sample Data

We will add a couple of tables to the <code spellcheck="false">cases</code> database and populate them with sample data to have information to work with throughout this lab.

1. At the PSQL Command Line Shell, run the following commands to create the <code spellcheck="false">cases</code> tables and data:

    > +++\i ./Scripts/initialize_dataset.sql;+++

1. This will produce results like these below

	!IMAGE[psql-load-data.jpg](instructions291546/psql-load-data.jpg)

### Explore Database

1. When working with <code spellcheck="false">psql</code> at the VS Code Command Line Shell, enabling the extended display for query results may be helpful, as it improves the readability of output for subsequent commands. Execute the following command to allow the extended display to be automatically applied.

    > +++\x auto+++

1. First we will retrieve a sample of data from the cases table in our cases dataset. This allows us to examine the structure and content of the data stored in the database.

    > +++SELECT name FROM cases LIMIT 5;+++

===

## Install and configure the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension

>[!alert] Make sure you continue to use the **VS Code PSQL Command Line Shell** for the following steps.

Before using the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension, you must install it into your database and configure it to connect to your Azure AI Services resources. The <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension allows you to integrate the Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Language services into your database. To enable the extension in your database, follow these steps:

1. Execute the following command in **VS Code PSQL Command Line Shell** to verify that the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code>, <code spellcheck="false">vector</code>, <code spellcheck="false">age</code> and <code spellcheck="false">pg_diskann</code> extensions were successfully added to your server's *allowlist* by the Bicep deployment script that was ran automatically when your lab environment setup:

	> +++SHOW azure.extensions;+++

The command displays the list of extensions on the server's *allowlist*.
If everything was correctly installed, your output must include `azure_ai`, `vector`, `age` and `pg_diskann` like this:

```sql-nocopy
azure.extensions 
------------------
azure_ai,vector,age,pg_diskann
```

> [!note] For future reference, before an extension can be installed and used in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database, it must be added to the server's *allowlist*, as described in [how to use PostgreSQL extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-extensions#how-to-use-postgresql-extensions).

2. Now, you are ready to install the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension using the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command.  Run the following command on the PSQL Command Shell:

	> +++CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS azure_ai;+++
    
<code spellcheck="false">CREATE EXTENSION</code> loads a new extension into the database by running its script file. This script typically creates new SQL objects such as functions, data types, and schemas. An error is thrown if an extension of the same name already exists. Adding <code spellcheck="false">IF NOT EXISTS</code> allows the command to execute without throwing an error if it is already installed.

===

### Explore the Azure AI schema and Setup `azure_ai` extension

The <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> schema provides the framework for directly interacting with Azure AI and ML services from your database. It contains functions for setting up connections to those services and retrieving them from the <code spellcheck="false">settings</code> table, which is also hosted in the same schema. The <code spellcheck="false">settings</code> table provides secure storage in the database for endpoints and keys associated with your Azure AI and ML services.

1. Review the functions defined in the  <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> schema.
    1. You can review the full schema details in the [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-overview#configure-the-azure_ai-extension)


         Schema   |  Name       | Result data type | Argument data types  | Type
        ----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------|------
         azure_ai | get_setting | text      | key text                    | func
         azure_ai | set_setting | void      | key text, value text        | func
         azure_ai | version		| text      |                             | func

		<br>

		> [!knowledge] Because the connection information for Azure AI services, including API keys, is stored in a configuration table in the database, the <code 							spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension defines a role called <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai_settings_manager</code> to ensure this information is protected and accessible only to users who have been assigned that role. This role enables reading and writing of settings related to the extension. Only members of the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai_settings_manager</code> role can invoke the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai.get_setting()</code> and <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai.set_setting()</code> functions. In an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, all admin users (those with the <code spellcheck="false">azure_pg_admin</code> role assigned) are also assigned the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai_settings_manager</code> role.
    
    <br>

1. To demonstrate how you use the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai.set_setting()</code> and <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai.get_setting()</code> functions, configure the connection to your Azure OpenAI account:

    1. To make getting the Azure OpenAI Endpoint and Key a little easier, we have a PowerShell script to grab them:
    1. Open "Terminal" by clicking the Terminal icon in the Task Menu
		<br>!IMAGE[terminal-icon.jpg](instructions291546/terminal-icon.jpg)
	1. Navigate to the path below using the following command: `cd C:\users\labuser\downloads\pg-sk-agents-lab\scripts\`
    1. Enter the following script name to run it: `.\get_env.ps1`
    1. Copy the values for `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`

1. Once you have your endpoint and key, go back to VS Code and the PSQL Command Shell, then use the commands below to add your values to the configuration table. Ensure you replace the <code spellcheck="false">{AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}</code> and <code spellcheck="false">{AZURE_OPENAI_KEY}</code> tokens with the values you copied from the script output.

	> +++SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.endpoint', '{AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}');+++

    > +++SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key', '{AZURE_OPENAI_KEY}');+++    

    When you add the key, the command should look like: 
    * *SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.endpoint', 'https://oai-learn-eastus-123456.openai.azure.com/');*
    * *SELECT azure_ai.set_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key', 'd33a123456781');*

1. You can verify the settings written into the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai.settings</code> table using the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai.get_setting()</code> function in the following queries:

	> +++SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.endpoint');+++

    > +++SELECT azure_ai.get_setting('azure_openai.subscription_key');+++

Congratulations, the <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> PostgreSQL extension is now connected to your Azure OpenAI account!

===
### Review the Azure OpenAI schema

The <code spellcheck="false">azure_openai</code> schema provides the ability to integrate the creation of vector embedding of text values into your database using Azure OpenAI. Using this schema, you can [generate embeddings with Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) directly from the database to create vector representations of input text, which can then be used in vector similarity searches, as well as consumed by machine learning models. The schema contains a single function, <code spellcheck="false">create_embeddings()</code>, with two overloads. One overload accepts a single input string, and the other expects an array of input strings.

1. Review the details of the functions in the <code spellcheck="false">azure_openai</code> schema.

    * Review in the [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-openai#configure-openai-endpoint-and-key)

    The docs will show the two overloads of the <code spellcheck="false">azure_openai.create_embeddings()</code> function, allowing you to review the differences between the two versions of the function and the types they return.

2. To provide a simplified example of using the function, run the following query, which creates a vector embedding for a sample query. The <code spellcheck="false">deployment_name</code> parameter in the function is set to <code spellcheck="false">embedding</code>, which is the name of the deployment of the <code spellcheck="false">text-embedding-3-small</code> model in your Azure OpenAI service:

	> +++SELECT LEFT(azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small', 'Sample text for PostgreSQL Lab')::text, 100) AS vector_preview;+++

The output looks similar to this:

```sql-nocopy
 vector_preview
----+-----------------------------------------------------------
 {0.020068742,0.00022734122,0.0018286322,-0.0064167166,...}
```

Note: for brevity, the vector embeddings are abbreviated in the above output.

[Embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-overview#embeddings) are a concept in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) that involves representing objects such as words, documents, or entities, as [vectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-overview#vectors) in a multi-dimensional space. Embeddings allow machine learning models to evaluate how closely two pieces of information are related. This technique efficiently identifies relationships and similarities between data, allowing algorithms to identify patterns and make accurate predictions.

The <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension allows you to generate embeddings for input text. To enable the generated vectors to be stored alongside the rest of your data in the database, you must install the <code spellcheck="false">vector</code> extension by following the guidance in the [enable vector support in your database](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/how-to-use-pgvector#enable-extension) documentation. However, that is outside of the scope of this exercise.

# Part 2 - Using AI-driven features in Postgres

In this section, we will explore how to leverage AI-driven features within PostgreSQL to enhance data processing and analysis. These features can help automate tasks, improve data insights, and provide advanced functionalities that traditional SQL queries may not offer.

>[!alert] For these next tasks, we will switch to using the **VS Code PostgreSQL Extension Query Editor**.  Follow the steps below to use that.

## Open New Query Editor in VS Code PostgreSQL extension

1. If not already there, click on the Elephant Icon on the left navigation to open the VS Code PostgreSQL extension

	!IMAGE[vs-code-elephant.jpg](instructions291546/vs-code-elephant.jpg)

1. Expand the Databases Node, and Right Click on `cases` database, select `New Query` option

	!IMAGE[vscode-new-query.jpg](instructions291546/vscode-new-query.jpg)

1. This will open a new query editor window like below.
    1. Notice on the bottom right, you can see a green circle indicating you are successfully connected to database
    1. Also notice, you can hover your mouse over the green icon and see a popup showing you what database and server host you are connected to
    1. You should be connected to the `cases` database

		!IMAGE[vscode-db-green.jpg](instructions291546/vscode-db-green.jpg)

1. Now let's run a test query in the editor window to see how it works.
    1. Enter the following SQL query below in the query editor

    	> +++SELECT NAME FROM CASES LIMIT 5;+++
    
    1. Next click the green play ">" icon in the top right tool bar.  Notice the results open in PostgreSQL Query Results panel 
    
    	!IMAGE[vscode-query-play.jpg](instructions291546/vscode-query-play.jpg)

===

## Using Pattern matching for queries

>[!alert] For these next tasks, we will use the **VS Code PostgreSQL Extension Query Editor**.  Paste in the queries below into your query editor window.

We will explore how to use the <code spellcheck="false">ILIKE</code> clause in SQL to perform case-insensitive searches within text fields. This is particularly useful when you want to find specific cases or reviews that contain certain keywords.

1. We will start by searching for cases mentioning `"Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above."`

    ```sql
    SELECT id, name, opinion
    FROM cases
    WHERE opinion ILIKE '%Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above';
    ```

    You'll get a result similar to this:

    ```sql-nocopy
    id | name | opinion
    ----+------+---------
    (0 rows)
    ```

	However, it does not find any results because those *exact* words are not mentioned in the opinion. As you can see there are no results for what to user wants to find. We need to try another approach.

    Next we will see how we can improve on this using Semantic Vector Search.

===

## Using Semantic Vector Search and DiskANN Index

In this section, we will focus on generating and storing embedding vectors.  We are going to use these in our Agent App in later steps. Embedding vectors represent data points in a high-dimensional space, allowing for efficient similarity searches and advanced analytics.

### Create, Store and Index Embedding Vectors

Now that we have some sample data, it's time to generate and store the embedding vectors. The <code spellcheck="false">azure_ai</code> extension makes calling the Azure OpenAI embedding API easy.

1. Now, you are ready to install the <code spellcheck="false">vector</code> extension using the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command.

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
    ```

1. Add the embedding vector column. The <code spellcheck="false">text-embedding-3-small</code> model is configured to return 1,536 dimensions, so use that for the vector column size.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE cases ADD COLUMN opinions_vector vector(1536);
    ```

1. Generate an embedding vector for the opinion of each case by calling Azure OpenAI through the create_embeddings user-defined function, which is implemented by the azure_ai extension:

    ```sql
    UPDATE cases
    SET opinions_vector = azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small',  name || LEFT(opinion, 8000), max_attempts => 5, retry_delay_ms => 500)::vector
    WHERE opinions_vector IS NULL;
    ```

    >[!alert] This may take several minutes, depending on the available quota.

1. Adding an [DiskANN Vector Index](https://aka.ms/pg-diskann-docs) to improve vector search speed. 

    Using [DiskANN Vector Index in Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://aka.ms/pg-diskann-blog) - DiskANN is a scalable approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm for efficient vector search at any scale. It offers high recall, high queries per second (QPS), and low query latency, even for billion-point datasets. This makes it a powerful tool for handling large volumes of data. [Learn more about DiskANN from Microsoft](https://aka.ms/pg-diskann-docs). Now, you are ready to install the <code spellcheck="false">pg_diskann</code> extension using the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command.

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_diskann;
    ```
1. Create the diskann index on a table column that contains vector data.

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX cases_cosine_diskann ON cases USING diskann(opinions_vector vector_cosine_ops);
    ```
    as you scale your data to millions of rows, DiskANN makes vector search more efficient.

1. See an example vector by running this query:

    ```sql
    SELECT opinions_vector FROM cases LIMIT 1;
    ```

    you will get a result similar to this, but with 1536 vector columns. The output will take up alot of your screen, just hit enter to move down the page to see all of the output:

    ```sql-nocopy
    opinions_vector | 
    [-0.0018742813,-0.04530062,0.055145424, ... ]
    ```
===

### Perform a Semantic Search Query

Now that you have listing data augmented with embedding vectors, it's time to run a semantic search query. To do so, get the query string embedding vector, then perform a cosine search to find the cases whose opinions that are most semantically similar to the query.

1. Generate the embedding for the query string.

    ```sql
    SELECT azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small', 'Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above.');
    ```

    you will get a result like this:

    ```sql
    create_embeddings | 
    {-0.0020871465,-0.002830255,0.030923981, ...}
    ```
2. Use the embedding in a cosine search (<code spellcheck="false"><=></code> represents cosine distance operation), fetching the top 10 most similar cases to the query.

    ```sql
    SELECT id, name
    FROM cases
    ORDER BY opinions_vector <=> azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small', 'Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above.')::vector 
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

    You'll get a result similar to this. Results may vary, as embedding vectors are not guaranteed to be deterministic:

    ```sql-nocopy
        id    |                          name                          
        ---------+--------------------------------------------------------
        615468 | Le Vette v. Hardman Estate
        768356 | Uhl Bros. v. Hull
        8848167 | Wilkening v. Watkins Distributors, Inc.
        558730 | Burns v. Dufresne
        594079 | Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.
        1086651 | Bach v. Sarich
        869848 | Tailored Ready Co. v. Fourth & Pike Street Corp.
        2601920 | Pappas v. Zerwoodis
        4912975 | Conradi v. Arnold
        1091260 | Brant v. Market Basket Stores, Inc.
        (10 rows)

    ```
3. You may also project the <code spellcheck="false">opinion</code> column to be able to read the text of the matching rows whose opinions were semantically similar. For example, this query returns the best match:

    ```sql
    SELECT id, opinion
    FROM cases
    ORDER BY opinions_vector <=> azure_openai.create_embeddings('text-embedding-3-small', 'Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above.')::vector 
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

which prints something like:

```sql-nocopy
    id          | opinion
    ------------+----------------------------
    615468       | "Morris, J.\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease...."
```

To intuitively understand semantic search, observe that the opinion mentioned doesn't actually contain the terms <code spellcheck="false">"Water leaking into the apartment from the floor above."</code>. However it does highlight a document with a section that says <code spellcheck="false">"nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story"</code> which is similar.
